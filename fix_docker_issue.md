# Docker Desktop Issue Fix

## The Problem
Error: `unable to get image 'cursor-email-automation': error during connect: Get "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.51/images/cursor-email-automation/json": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified`

This means Docker Desktop isn't running or properly installed.

## Solution 1: Fix Docker Desktop (Optional)

### Install Docker Desktop
1. Download Docker Desktop for Windows: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Run the installer
3. **Important**: Enable WSL 2 integration during setup
4. Restart your computer after installation
5. Start Docker Desktop from Start menu
6. Wait for Docker to fully start (whale icon in system tray)

### Test Docker
```cmd
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

### Then run with Docker
```cmd
docker-compose up -d
```

## Solution 2: Use Python Setup (Recommended - Already Working!)

Since we already have Python working, just use:

### Option A: Use the batch files
1. Double-click `start_app.bat`
2. Your browser opens automatically to http://localhost:8000

### Option B: Manual commands
```cmd
cd C:\Aces\iDrive\Office\Team\Apps\Cursor\automated-email-response
.\.venv311\Scripts\activate.bat
python server.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

## Why Python Setup is Better for Development

- ✅ Faster startup
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ✅ Direct file access
- ✅ No Docker complexity
- ✅ Already working on your system

## If You Still Want Docker

1. **Install Docker Desktop** (link above)
2. **Enable WSL 2**: Windows Features → WSL → Install
3. **Restart** your computer
4. **Start Docker Desktop**
5. **Wait** for it to fully load (green whale icon)
6. **Then run**: `docker-compose up -d`

## Quick Test

To see if your Python setup is working:
- Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
- You should see the Email Automation dashboard
- If it loads, you're all set! No Docker needed.
